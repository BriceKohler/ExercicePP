# ExercicePP
## Task manager made as exercise for Petitpierre job application

- ExercicePP : main project
- ExercicePPTest : Nunit test project

## Features
- Showing tasks, with delay and color code for emergency status
- Adding tasks
- Editing tasks
- Deleting tasks
- Setting tasks as finished
- Filtering tasks, from name, responsible or done status
- Sorting tasks, from property name
- Saving task list in local file before quitting

## Tech
- Mvvm Toolkit has not been used due to the time to master it.
- Sorting and filtering function have not been included in the listview control. It's been best compromise to stay in mvvm (no code-behind), not using custom controls (as Telerik's or so), and keep a simple solution without behavior.

## Development
